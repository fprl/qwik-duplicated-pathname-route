# Issue with rewrite routes, qwik speak and vite?

Hey everyone, do you know how to solve this issue when needing duplicated rewrite routes pointing to the same file? I upgraded my site to > 1.7.2 and can't build it:

> More than one route has been found for pathname "..."

I thought this was already solved in [v.1.5.6](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/releases/
tag/v1.5.6), in [fix(qwikcity): duplicated rewrite routes with multiple prefixes by @shairez in #6377](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/pull/6377).

### Steps
1. `npm run build` and you will see the error.

Thank you!
